# bookstore

This is a fresh looking node.js bookstore. It fetches Google's Books API and uses MongoDB for local storage. The shop has all the functions you'd expect from a bookstore and I'm working on adding some exciting, personalization stuff later on. 

It is of course responsive and was developed to be mobile friendly.
