# bookstore

This is a fresh looking node.js bookstore. It fetches Google's Books API and uses MongoDB for local storage. The shop has the basic CRUD functions and I'm working on adding some exciting, personalization stuff down the line. It is of course responsive and I was developing it for mobiles first.
